    "**Conclusions:**  \n",
    "- Color (Hue, Saturation) and shape (Circularity) were key discriminators among fruit types.  \n",
    "- The dataset was diverse enough to train a solid baseline model.  \n",
    "- Traditional ML models still perform strongly when features are well-designed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Work:**  \n",
    "- 🧩 Add a CNN (Deep Learning) model for comparison.  \n",
    "- 📸 Include image quality metrics (sharpness, brightness).  \n",
    "- 🌈 Deploy the model with a small web app using Streamlit or Flask.  \n",
